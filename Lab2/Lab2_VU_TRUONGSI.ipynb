    "- You have to fill in the code in this notebook and upload it to back to blackboard for submission. While doing this, make sure that all supporting files that you download from blackboard are in the same directory as this notebook. And remember to rename your file as \"Lab2_[YOUR FIRSTNAME]_[YOUR LASTNAME].ipynb\".(For me, I'll turn in a file called Lab2_Yujie_Zhang.ipynb)\n",
