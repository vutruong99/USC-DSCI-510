    "FAQs:  \n",
    "Q. How to read/parse a website?  \n",
    "A. For that, as taught in the class you would need to use libraries like BeautifulSoup, urllib or requests.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. What am I getting anyway when I read the website?  \n",
    "A. You are getting the whole html code written for the website, when you read/parse the website.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. I don't know html, what should I do?  \n",
    "A. No worries. For this lab, you only need to understand that html is another type of a language made up of tags. For example, it has heading info in the *head* tag, paragraph has *p* tag, and html links have *a* tag. So, using the tag, you can get the info you need!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. How do I get the tag info?  \n",
    "A. When you get your BeautifulSoup object you can do something like object.find_all('tag') or object('tag') to get all 'tag' tags.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. What are tag attributes and how can I access that?  \n",
    "A. HTML attributes are special words used inside the tag to control the element's behaviour. One can access attributes using *get* function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. I got the tag, but what I got seems cryptic. What now?  \n",
    "A. So, once you get the info from a particular tag, you get the whole html code inside that tag. If you want some particular information from that, you would need to call functions like get and get_text to get the information directly without messing with the html code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. I am not sure how to use these functions. Help?  \n",
    "A. You can read from the official documentation. Link: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/  \n",
    "\n",
    "Good Feature: Use the .prettify() feature of BeautifulSoup. You'll get a better insight of what is that you are scrapping. \n",
