    "- You will be given the lab assignment in the start of the lab. You're supposed to complete it by the deadline. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You've to complete the assignments individually. If you are having trouble completing the assignment do let me know, I will clear your doubts and guide you but I'll not write code for you and no one else should :) !!!  \n",
    "\n",
    "- You have to fill in the code in this notebook and upload it to back to blackboard for submission. While doing this, make sure that all supporting files that you download from blackboard are in the same directory as this notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- You are encouraged to look up resources online like python docs and stackoverflow. But, you are encouraged to look up the topics and not the questions themselves  \n",

    "- Use the ```type``` function and ```dir``` function whenever possible to understand what you have vs what did you expect and what you can do with what you have.\n",
    "- Give attention to the brackets while looking at a json so that you know what you will get after parsing it. \n",

    "\n",
    "For all news headlines for the website, you have to look for the link to the article and the headline text which **contains the keyword(specifically, in the headline) passed to you in the function argument**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the return values, you have to return a list of tuples where a particular tuple's 0th value is the link to the article and the 1st value is the headline text.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Note 1: Keyword and headlines should not be considered case-sensitive.\n",
    "Note 2: Call ```strip()``` over the link and the headline text, so that it is more readable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "FAQs:  \n",
    "Q. How to read/parse a website?  \n",
    "A. For that, as taught in the class you would need to use libraries like BeautifulSoup, urllib or requests.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. What am I getting anyway when I read the website?  \n",
    "A. You are getting the whole html code written for the website, when you read/parse the website.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. I don't know html, what should I do?  \n",
    "A. No worries. For this lab, you only need to understand that html is another type of a language made up of tags. For example, it has heading info in the *head* tag, paragraph has *p* tag, and html links have *a* tag. So, using the tag, you can get the info you need!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. How do I get the tag info?  \n",
    "A. When you get your BeautifulSoup object you can do something like object.find_all('tag') or object('tag') to get all 'tag' tags.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. What are tag attributes and how can I access that?  \n",
    "A. HTML attributes are special words used inside the tag to control the element's behaviour. One can access attributes using *get* function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. I got the tag, but what I got seems cryptic. What now?  \n",
    "A. So, once you get the info from a particular tag, you get the whole html code inside that tag. If you want some particular information from that, you would need to call functions like get and get_text to get the information directly without messing with the html code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. I am not sure how to use these functions. Help?  \n",
    "A. You can read from the official documentation. Link: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/  \n",
    "\n",
    "Good Feature: Use the .prettify() feature of BeautifulSoup. You'll get a better insight of what is that you are scrapping. \n",
