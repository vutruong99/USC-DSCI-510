a) Python is a dynamically typed language. It is also an interpreted and object-oriented programming language.

b) Values from the input()  function in Python are returned as strings.

c) The value of 9 > 6 or abracadabra is True. 

d) Because one of the conditions is true (9 is greater than 6), we do not care about the variable abracadabra.

e) The value of 9 > 6 and abracadabra is an error stating that abracadabra is undefined: "NameError: name "abracadabra" is not defined"

f) The value of the statement above depends on the variable abracadabra. If abracadabra is not defined before the statement, an error will be return. However, if it has a value, then the value of the statement can be True or False depending on abracadabra’s value.

g) Function type() gives information about the type of a Python object.
