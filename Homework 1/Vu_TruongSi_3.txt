Import the random library
Generate a random integer between 1 and 10 by using the randint function
Initialize a variable call count = 1 to keep track of the user’s number of tries

Try to execute the flow below:
Prompt the user for input and assign that to the guess variable
While the guess does not equal the random integer:
	Increase count by 1

	If the guess is greater than the random integer:
		Print the hint saying that the guess is greater
		Prompt the user for new input and assign that to the guess variable

	If the guess is smaller than the random integer:
		Print the hint saying that the guess is smaller
		Prompt the user for new input and assign that to the guess variable

Print the number of tries and notify the user that the guess is correct
Except:
	Prompt error message
